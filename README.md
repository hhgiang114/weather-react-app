# Weather React App
A simple weather app built with React

# Notes
My very first React application with simple function to find and check the weather of a city, and the weather forecast for 5 days. 
Although the weather forecast part is showed as locally but it disappears after deployed and hosted in Github pages. 


# APIs
## Weather data is retrieved from http://openweathermap.org/
